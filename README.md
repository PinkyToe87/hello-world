# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository

My name is Carlos Pimentel and I'm on the web developer journey. I've learned html, css, js (although by foundations aren't solid), and React. 
I have a React project ready to go live - it's a simple informational website promoting our local lions club - but I'm not sure how. 
Everything seems to point to GitHub, so I've created my account and learning the how-tos

I hope to become a skillful developer and start a business soon. <3
